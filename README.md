Title: Spanish-style Spicy Potato and Portobello Mushroom Bake

Overview: This Spanish-inspired dish combines the heartiness of potatoes and portobello mushrooms with the bold flavors of spicy tomato sauce and garlic. Crisp bacon and fragrant rosemary complete the dish, making it a satisfying meal that's perfect for chilly nights.

Ingredients:
- 4 large potatoes, sliced into ¼ inch rounds
- 4 portobello mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
- 2 medium shallots, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 large tomatoes, diced
- 3-4 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped
- 4 strips of bacon, chopped
- 1 cup of spicy tomato sauce
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Olive oil, as needed

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the chopped bacon until crisp. Remove from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, add a tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the diced shallots until they start to soften.

4. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant.

5. Add the sliced portobello mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are browned and tender. Transfer the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic to a large mixing bowl.

6. Add the sliced potatoes, diced tomatoes, chopped rosemary, and spicy tomato sauce to the mixing bowl. Season with salt and pepper and stir well to combine.

7. Use the remaining olive oil to grease a large baking dish. Transfer the potato and mushroom mixture into the baking dish.

8. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.

9. After 45 minutes, remove the aluminum foil, and continue baking for 15-20 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender.

10. Sprinkle the reserved bacon bits over the top of the dish and serve hot.

Tips:
- Make sure to slice the potatoes and mushrooms evenly, so that they cook at the same rate.
- If the dish seems too dry before baking, add a splash of water or chicken stock to the mixture.
- Use fresh rosemary if possible, as it imparts the best flavor into the dish.
- For a milder version of this dish, use regular tomato sauce instead of spicy tomato sauce.

Note: Don't forget to buy olive oil, salt, and pepper for this recipe.

Sure! An alternative recipe that takes less time to cook is a Spanish-style potato and mushroom skillet. Here's the recipe:

Title: Quick Spanish-style Potato and Mushroom Skillet

Overview: This recipe is a delicious and easy one-pan dish that combines tender potatoes, meaty mushrooms, and spicy tomato sauce for a flavorful meal that's ready in under 30 minutes.

Ingredients:
- 4 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
- 8 oz portobello mushrooms, diced
- 2 shallots, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup of spicy tomato sauce
- 3-4 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 3 tbsp olive oil

Instructions:

1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil and sauté the chopped shallots until tender, then add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds.

2. Add the diced potatoes to the skillet and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until golden and crispy.

3. Add the diced mushrooms to the skillet and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes until they release their juices and are tender.

4. Add the spicy tomato sauce and chopped rosemary to the skillet, stirring to combine. Reduce heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 5-7 minutes, until the flavors meld together.

5. Season the skillet with salt and pepper to taste, then remove it from heat and let it sit for a couple of minutes before serving.

6. Serve hot, garnished with additional fresh rosemary if desired.

Tips:
- For a meatier dish, add diced bacon or crumbled sausage when cooking the shallots and garlic.
- If you want to make this dish even faster, you can use pre-diced potatoes that are sold in the frozen section of the grocery store.
- Instead of rosemary, you can use other herbs like thyme or oregano to add more depth of flavor to the dish.

Note: Don't forget to buy olive oil, salt, and pepper for this recipe.

> Can you suggest some spices I could add to this recipe?

Sure! Adding additional spices can really enhance the flavor of this dish. Here are a few options:

1. Smoked paprika: Adds a smoky, slightly sweet flavor that pairs well with potatoes and mushrooms. Start with 1/2 tsp and adjust to taste.

2. Cumin: Provides earthy, nutty notes to the dish. Start with 1/2 tsp and adjust to taste.

3. Red pepper flakes: If you want to turn up the heat, add red pepper flakes to taste.

4. Turmeric: This spice adds a warm, peppery flavor and a bright yellow color to the dish. Start with 1/4 tsp and adjust to taste.

5. Garam masala: A blend of Indian spices that adds warmth and complexity to the dish. Start with 1/2 tsp and adjust to taste.

When experimenting with spices, start with a small amount and taste as you go. You can always add more, but it's difficult to take them away. Enjoy!
