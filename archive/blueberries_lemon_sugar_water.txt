Blueberry Lemon Syrup:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup blueberries
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 lemon, juiced and zested

Instructions:

1. In a small saucepan, combine the blueberries, sugar, and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.

2. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the mixture for about 10 minutes, or until the blueberries have broken down and the mixture has thickened slightly.

3. Stir in the lemon juice and zest and continue to simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes.

4. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.

5. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible.

6. Serve the syrup warm or chilled over pancakes, waffles, or ice cream.
