I apologize for any confusion before. Here is a recipe that combines onion, radish, fennel, salmon, and orange with Chinese and spicy tags:

Spicy Chinese-style Salmon with Orange and Fennel Salad

Overview:
This dish combines the unique flavors of Chinese cuisine with the rich taste of salmon for a sumptuous meal. The fresh fennel and orange salad, along with the added kick of the spicy marinade, makes this dish a refreshing and flavorful twist on traditional salmon.

Ingredients:

Salmon:
- 4 salmon fillets
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 tbsp. honey
- 1 tbsp. Hoisin sauce
- 1 tbsp. Sriracha sauce
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp. ginger, minced
- 2 tbsp. sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. black pepper

Salad:
- 1/2 fennel bulb, thinly sliced
- 1 radish, thinly sliced
- 1/2 onion, thinly sliced
- 2 oranges, segmented
- 1 tbsp. rice wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, honey, Hoisin sauce, Sriracha sauce, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper.
3. Place the salmon fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the marinade over the salmon.
4. Bake the salmon for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked through and flaky.
5. While the salmon is baking, prepare the salad. In a medium bowl, toss together the thinly sliced fennel bulb, radish, onion, and segmented oranges. Drizzle with rice wine vinegar and olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.
6. When the salmon is cooked, place each fillet on a serving plate and add a scoop of the salad on the side.

Tips and Issues:
- Be careful when cooking salmon, because it can easily overcook and become dry. Check the salmon after 12 minutes, and then continue cooking until it reaches your desired level of doneness.
- If you prefer less spice, reduce or eliminate the Sriracha sauce from the marinade.
- To get neat orange segments, cut off the top and bottom of each orange, then cut off the peel and white pith, and then cut out the orange segments between the membranes.
- If you cannot find fennel, you can substitute it with thinly sliced celery or cucumber.
