Chinese Spicy Salmon Stir-Fry with Fennel, Radish, and Oranges

Ingredients:
- 4 salmon fillets, cut into pieces
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 fennel bulb, sliced
- 4 radishes, sliced
- 2 oranges, peeled and segmented
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon of ginger, minced
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon of honey
- 1 tablespoon of cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes

Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.

2. Heat the vegetable oil in a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the sliced onion and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.

3. Add the sliced fennel and minced garlic and ginger to the pan. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the fennel starts to soften. 

4. Add the sliced radish, and continue cooking for an additional 2-3 minutes until the radishes are crisp-tender.

5. Add the salmon pieces to the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through.

6. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the pan and stir to coat the ingredients. Add the orange segments and stir gently to combine.

7. Serve the stir-fry with steamed rice or noodles.

Tips: Be careful not to overcook the salmon, as it can become tough and dry. You can adjust the level of spiciness by adding more or less red pepper flakes. If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add more cornstarch to the soy sauce mixture. Lastly, make sure to cut all the ingredients into similar sizes so they cook evenly.

Note: You will also need to buy soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, and rice or noodles for serving.
