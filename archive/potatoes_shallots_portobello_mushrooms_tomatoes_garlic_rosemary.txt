Potato and Portobello Mushroom Enchiladas with Spicy Tomato Sauce

Ingredients:
- 6 medium potatoes, peeled and diced
- 4 shallots, chopped
- 4 portobello mushrooms, sliced
- 4 tomatoes, chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 8-10 corn tortillas
- 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 cups of canned tomato puree
- 1 jalapeño pepper, chopped
- 1 teaspoon of ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon of chili powder

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the potatoes, shallots, and mushrooms, and cook until the potatoes are golden brown and tender. Season with salt, pepper, and chopped rosemary.

3. In a separate pan, cook the chopped tomatoes and minced garlic until the tomatoes are soft and the garlic is fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder. Add the canned tomato puree and chopped jalapeño pepper, and simmer for 10-15 minutes.

4. Add 2-3 tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the side of each tortilla, and then add a spoonful of the potato and mushroom mixture. Roll up each tortilla tightly, and place them seam-side down in a greased baking dish.

5. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the top of the tortillas, and sprinkle with shredded cheese.

6. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

7. Enjoy!

Note: You will also need to buy corn tortillas and cheddar cheese. To save time, you can use canned tomato puree instead of making your own. Be careful when handling jalapeño peppers, and wear gloves if necessary to avoid any skin irritation.
