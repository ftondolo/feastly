Sure! Here's a recipe for a delicious Italian-style beef ragù with pasta and parmesan:

Ingredients:
- 500g of minced beef
- 2 large carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 400g of pasta (spaghetti, tagliatelle or pappardelle work well)
- 500ml of tomato sauce
- 100g of grated parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for frying

Overview:
This Italian-style beef ragù is a hearty and satisfying dish that's perfect for a cozy night in with family or friends. The carrots and onions add a touch of sweetness to the savory minced beef, while the tomato sauce brings the entire dish together. Topped off with a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese, this pasta dish is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.

Tips:
- Make sure to cook the pasta al dente (meaning it's cooked but still slightly firm). Overcooked pasta can ruin the texture of the dish.
- If you find that the ragù is too dry, add a splash of water or beef broth to loosen it up.
- If you prefer a spicier dish, add some red pepper flakes or chili powder to the ragù.

Instructions:

1. In a large pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced onions and cook for 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.
2. Add the diced carrots and continue to cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender.
3. Add the minced beef to the pan and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula, until it has browned and there are no pink spots left. This should take around 10 minutes.
4. Add the tomato sauce to the pan and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and let the ragù simmer for at least 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. While the ragù is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the package, until it's al dente.
6. Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the ragù. Toss everything together until the pasta is coated in the sauce.
7. Sprinkle the grated parmesan cheese over the top of the ragù and serve immediately.

Note: Don't forget to buy salt and pepper!
