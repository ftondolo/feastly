Spanish Spicy Pork and Potato Stew with Fennel and Orange Salad

Ingredients:
- 1 lb pork shoulder, cut into 1 inch pieces 
- 4 medium potatoes, diced into small cubes 
- 1 small fennel bulb, thinly sliced 
- 2 medium shallots, finely chopped 
- 2 cloves of garlic minced 
- 1/2 cup olives, pitted 
- 2 tablespoons capers 
- 2 bay leaves 
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika 
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves 
- 2 cups chicken broth 
- juice of 1 orange 
- zest of 1 orange 
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 

For the Fennel and Orange Salad:
- 1 small fennel bulb, thinly sliced 
- 1 small orange, peeled and cut into small pieces 
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste 

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375F.

2. Season the pork with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Brown the pork on all sides for about 5-7 minutes until golden brown.

3. Add the garlic, shallots, and fennel to the pot and saute for another 5 minutes until the vegetables soften.

4. Add the smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, dried thyme, chicken broth, bay leaf, capers, and olives. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 30 minutes until the pork is tender.

5. Add the diced potatoes to the pot and stir to combine. Cover the pot and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 30-40 minutes until the potatoes are tender and cooked through.

6. In the meantime, prepare the fennel and orange salad by mixing the thinly sliced fennel and orange pieces in a bowl. Add the olive oil, salt, and freshly ground black pepper to the bowl and toss to combine.

7. Once the stew is ready, remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Serve the stew hot, garnished with orange zest and accompanied by the fennel and orange salad on the side.

Tips:
- Be careful not to overcook the pork or it might become chewy.
- Adjust the level of spiciness according to your preference.
- If the stew looks too dry, add more chicken broth or water.
- Alternatively, you can cook this on a stove-top using a heavy bottomed pot.
